It was found that after 8 weeks of consuming west coast Cheese, the obese patients had lost 3 lbs on average and significantly reduced C reactive protein C reactive protein levels to 30%, indicating an improved antioxidant balance. There was also an increase in HDL levels of 10-15%.\\n\\nRegularly Consuming West Coast Cheese is Significantly Lowers Your Risk for Coronary Heart Disease: A Population-based Study\\n\\nA group of researchers from Kaiser Permanente's San Jose, California office conducted a population-based study of 932 men and women over age 35 and found that regularly consuming west coast Cheese was significantly lowe:\\n\\nThis Harvard research suggested that humans can live off of only 4 different types of plant foods: Grain and corn, legumes (dried beans, dried peas, dry peas, dried peanuts, and kidney beans), fruits and vegetables, and dairy products and fats.
